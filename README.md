# Past Paper Scripts for A Levels

Getting past papers for A Levels is crucial for practice. Sometimes, websites are unreliable and may be down for maintenance when past papers are needed. Once, GCE Guide was down for several months during exam season (Oct 2023-Jan 2024). To prevent such occurrences from happening again, I made these scripts to download past papers and open them.

This repo is intended for other A Level students who wish to have a local reliable database of past papers that can be accessed whenever required without internet access. It also helps to open past papers in a structured way.

Note: Downloading the past papers is a one-time affair and usually takes 40 minutes for 5 subjects. Due to unusual traffic detection and limited internet speeds, the code may need to be modified to only download 1 subject's resoruces at a time.
